KSoft OptiOBJ
=============
This is a program I wrote within a day to help me optimize OBJ files to remove duplicate vertices/UVs/normals, it may be messy, but idc =]
Hopefully it can help you if you have an oddly specific problem with your OBJ files.
It is written in C# 4.0 for the .NET Framework 4.0, in Visual Studio 2010. You should be able to load it in any higher version though.
